  The work then turned to refreshing the UX of the teacher web app and re-writing the entire front-end that powered it. Over the past year Iâ€™ve worked with ClassDojo on all marketing design as well as the redesign &amp; rebuild of their teacher web app, helping them double their teacher user base to 2 million.
