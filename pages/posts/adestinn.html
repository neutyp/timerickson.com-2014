Working with a small team, I lead all aspects of design and helped shape, architect the user interface and experience of the service. I conducted the entire stack of design, from in-person user research through wireframing to pixel-pushing design and execution in HTML/CSS. 

I also outlined Adestinn's social media goals and wrote strategies to grow the company's social footprint.

Here are a few select designs I created while at Adestinn:
