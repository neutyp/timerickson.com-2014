  In late March, 2014, ClassDojo launched ClassDojo Messaging â€” a new feature built into the existing teacher web, iOS, and Android experiences. 
</p>

<p>  
  Working alongside the mobile team, I designed and built (read: HTML, CSS) the web interface for the new messaging interface, as presented to both parents and teachers, to look seamless across devices.

<p>
  Before we could release the messaging feature to our teacher and parent users, we had to let them know what was new! The task then fell to me to create a marketing page touting the new communication tools in an interesting and interactive manner. 
</p>
<p>
  We originally planned to film a 'floating hand' using the updated app in a real school classroom. After several iterations of concept, we opted to keep the phone static, but animate the actions a user would take within the actual app.

<p>
  To achieve the 'screencasted' video of the iPhone, I ran the app locally in Xcode and and captured the movement a finger would take. For brevity sake, I used FCP X to edit down some segments and re-created natural app animations to cover the gaps caused by editing.

  The work then turned to refreshing the UX of the teacher web app and re-writing the entire front-end that powered it.
