  Over the past year I've worked with ClassDojo to improve the user experience for both teachers and parents, helping them double the teacher user base to 2 million teachers worldwide. On February 14th, 2014, teachers awarded the 1 billionth piece of feedback on ClassDojo. Thatâ€™s 1,000,000,000 moments when teachers have recognized students for doing something wonderful!

  To celebrate, I had the idea to create an infographic showing the impact of 1 billion moments. This project was concepted, and launched within 1 week, with exception to the wonderful illustrations created by <a href="//dribbble.com/monica-harvancik">Monica Harvancik</a> and the video animation by <a href="//github.com/liamdon">Liam Don</a>, all work was done by myself from design to HTML/CSS.
