  As of February 14th, 2014, teachers have given students over 1 billion pieces of feedback on ClassDojo. Thatâ€™s 1,000,000,000 moments when teachers have recognized students for doing something wonderful!
</p>

<p>  
  I designed and built (read: HTML, CSS) the marketing page for the 1 billion points announcement.

<a class="fancy" href="{% static '/posts/mini_browser-3@2x.png' %}"><img class="featured 2x" src="{% static '/posts/mini_browser-3.png' %}" /></a>

  The work then turned to refreshing the UX of the teacher web app and re-writing the entire front-end that powered it.
